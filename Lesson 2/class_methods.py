    # This method is a class method, meaning it works with the class and not an instance.
    # It creates a special Dog instance with some fixed characteristics.
    # 'cls' refers to the class itself, meaning it can be used to create new instances.
    # The default name is 'BigDog' and the default age is 120, but these can be overwritten.
    # After creating an instance, it sets its status to 'Big' and then returns it.
    # Example:
    # big_dog = Dog.create_special()
    # This will create a Dog instance named 'BigDog' with age 120 and status 'Big'.

    @staticmethod
    # This method is a static method, meaning it doesn't require a class or instance to be called.
    # It performs some utility function, indicated here by printing a message and returning True.
    # It takes any input and a dog_instance as arguments but doesn't use them in this example.
    # Example:
    # Dog.ultility_func("input", my_dog)
    # This will print 'Something very useful done here' but won't alter the 'my_dog' instance.
    def ultility_func(some_input, dog_instance):
        print('Something very useful done here')
